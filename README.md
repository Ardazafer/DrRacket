# DrRacket

### Some of my personal DrRacket projects that i've made in 2016
Some of them are finished, some of them are not and some of them are commented some of them are not.



- **Bounce:**
It is basically the breakout game but i called it bounce just because i couldn't remember the actual name of the game when i was making this :D

- **Draw-Bounce:**
This is the graphics of the game i created a seperate file to test particle effects or test new graphics.

- **Maze Generator:**
This is the random maze generator program. I used [Recursive Backtracking Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) for this.

- **Meteors:**
This is the clone of "Asteroids" game. Again, i called it meteors not because i tried to make a silly joke but i actually couldn't remember the original name :D

- **Mine Sweeper:**
I love this game!

- **Paint:**
This is not a finished project but i challenged myself to make a paint program in DrRacket and i almost did it. You're starting with drawing rectangles and when you press "p" it switches to "pen mode" and when you press "r" it switches to "rectangle mode". There is one problem though; when you're in the "rectangle mode" you can see the pen drawings just fine but when you're in the "pen mode" you can't see the rectangles. I couldn't fix it but i like this project.

- **Space-Invaders:**
This is a clone of space invaders game but with only blocks. I was planning to do the actual graphics like aliens and ship but I didn't do that.

- **The Ping Pong:**
It's the classical pong game with cool shooting mechanics. I like this particular project a LOT because it is my first DrRacket game. I'm really happy about it :D
